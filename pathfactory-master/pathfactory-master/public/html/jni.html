  <h1>Knowledge About Internships <i class="far fa-meh-rolling-eyes" style="font-size: 35px; color: indigo;"></i></h1>
  <p>
    An internship is a carefully monitored work or service experience in which an individual has intentional learning goals and reflects actively on what she or he is learning throughout the experience. It can be part of an educational program that is carefully monitored and evaluated for academic credit, or part of a learning plan that the intern develops.

Internships vary in duration. They can be part-time or full-time, paid or unpaid. The important element that distinguishes an internship from a short-term job is the intentional learning agenda that the intern brings to the experience and the employer provides.
    As the global job market becomes increasingly competitive, employees need to acquire as many skills and as much experience as possible. Internships represent temporary positions that college students often pursue to set themselves apart from the rest of the job candidate pool. 
  </p>
  <h3>Students who complete an internship are more likely to:</h3>
  <p>
       1. Find a job in desired field.<br>
       2. Make more money.<br>
       3. Have more job offers at graduation.<br>
       4. Have greater job satisfaction.<br>
       5. Have extended exposure to potential employers.<br>
       6. Make rapid advancements in the organization.<br>
       7. Get a solid lead with at least one employer.<br>
       8.Gain job references.<br>
       9. Possibly learn about something they don’t like to do.<br>
  
  </p>
  <h3>Internships help students:</h3>
  <p>
   1.Apply knowledge acquired in the classroom to real-world situations.<br>
 2.Develop analytical thinking skills and their discipline and its role in the modern world.<br>
3.Clarify attitudes about careers in their field.<br>
4.Improve time management, communication, and interpersonal skills.<br>
  </p>

  <h1>What to Consider when searching for Internship</h1>
  <p>Before you apply for internships, define the type of experience you want. Multiple internship structures exist including paid and unpaid positions as well as semester-based and summer programs, with some providing college credit. Hands-on training programs that are required for degree completion are often called practicums. Short professional experiences centered on job shadowing are known as externships. Finally, you may engage in cooperative educational experiences that span multiple years. During co-ops, you attend class and work with the partner company simultaneously.</p>
<p>The following sections cover additional attributes you should factor into your internship search.</p>
</div>
<h3>Internship goals</h3>
<p>To make positive professional impressions and maximize the benefits of an internship, you should establish goals far in advance. First-time interns might see the experience as a way to gain an understanding of their own work style. Students who have already completed multiple internships might see this opportunity as a way to develop a specific skill or decide between two career tracks.</p>
<h3>Time Commitment</h3>
<p>On top of setting concrete goals, you need to account for the time commitment of an internship. Companies and organizations generally publish such practical requirements to let students adjust their schedules as necessary. Ultimately, an internship should complement your education. If a position hinders your ability to succeed in school or maintain personal responsibilities, then it will not yield positive results. You won't be an effective intern if you stretch yourself too thin.</p>
<h3>Compensation</h3>
<p>Whether paid or unpaid, for-credit or non-credit, internships should benefit learners in significant ways.Interns who work in the for-profit/private sector and fulfill responsibilities that match a paid employee's job description legally qualify for the federal minimum hourly wage. The DOL also establishes six standards for unpaid internships, including discernable educational and professional results for the student.</p>

    How to Find a Job as a Recent Graduate 
  </h1>
  <p>
    Making the transition from student life to full-time employment comes with mixed emotions. Beginning your career might mean sacrificing late-night drinks on a Tuesday at the campus pub, but it comes with plenty of benefits. Just picture what you’ll do with that first paycheque.
    <br><br>
    Graduating from university or college and finding a job is a significant life event. And people handle it in different ways. Some new grads will take their time and go traveling to forestall the change. Others will be keen to get their professional lives started right away.
    <br><br>
    Regardless of when you plan on finding a job as a new grad, the process can be challenging. Many graduates lack familiarity with the basics of job searching, or how to sell themselves to employers when they have minimal work experience.
    <br>
  </p>
  <h3>
    10 Things to Do
  </h3>
  <p>
    All job hunters make mistakes at some point, and even if college graduates have had some of the job search hiccups above, they can still get back on track and land the position they want. The following tips can help recent grads boost their chances of getting hired.
  </p>
  <p>
    <i class="fas fa-network-wired" style="font-size: 30px; color: tomato;"></i>&nbsp; Network<br>
    Networking is one of the best ways to find employment. Start with family members, friends, neighbors, coworkers and professors to inquire about opportunities and get some leads. Join and attend professional organization meetings in your field<br>
    <i class="fas fa-hourglass-start" style="font-size: 30px; color: tomato;"></i>&nbsp;Don't Wait<br>
    As a career coach, my least favorite 4-letter word is W-A-I-T. College graduates often say ‘I’m waiting to hear back’, or ‘I’ve applied to 10 jobs online and nobody is calling me back,’” says Manciagli. “It is so much more motivating to know that you have the action item in your calendar to follow up in five working days from the day you applied. <br>
    <i class="fas fa-search" style="font-size: 30px; color: tomato;"></i>&nbsp;Do market research<br>
    “Once the graduate has a job goal, they need to research what the hiring companies are looking for,” Manciagli says. “Find 10 job descriptions and highlight all of the key words and phrases that are most commonly repeated. Then, that graduate can highlight those skills in their resume, cover letter and during their interview.<br>
    <i class="fas fa-briefcase" style="font-size: 30px; color: tomato;"></i>&nbsp;Expand your search<br>
    Sometimes job seekers may need to expand their requirements to find the right fit. In some cases, it may mean looking for positions in another city or state. Other times it may mean considering jobs outside their college major. Although making some of these decisions may not be ideal, they can be a jumping off point for entering the career world.<br>
    <i class="far fa-comments" style="font-size: 30px; color: tomato;"></i>&nbsp;Get in front of employers<br>
    “Take advantage of every available opportunity to connect with employers in person, such as job fairs, campus interviews and other networking events,” says Brush. “A resume can't tell your whole story to an employer, so an in-person meeting (no matter how brief) gives you an opportunity to provide details about your skills and experience. Employers tell us that face-to-face situations help them to confirm if a candidate will be a good fit for the job and organization.”<br>
    <i class="far fa-window-maximize" style="font-size: 30px; color: tomato;"></i>&nbsp;Create a personal Website<br>
    Job seekers can never get too much experience, and an internship is a great way to get it. Although it can feel like taking a step backwards to do an internship after college, more and more workers are using internships as a way to sharpen their existing skills or learn new ones in order to change careers. This is an especially good idea for graduates who didn’t have an internship while they were in school.<br>
    <i class="fas fa-cash-register" style="font-size: 30px; color: tomato;"></i>&nbsp;Consider a part-time job<br>
    Although it’s not ideal to work part-time, it can help to bring in money while you actively pursue full-time options. Also, employers appreciate candidates that demonstrate a strong work ethic.<br>
    <i class="fab fa-linkedin-in"style="font-size: 30px; color: tomato;"></i>&nbsp;Don't neglect Linkedin<br>
    Most recruiters use LinkedIn to find job candidates, so it’s important for recent graduates to devote job search time to connecting with potential employers on the site. In order to get the most out of LinkedIn, completely fill out your profile, connect with other alumni from your school and participate in groups related to your field.<br>
    <i class="far fa-comment-dots"style="font-size: 30px; color: tomato;"></i>&nbsp;Get advice from campus career center<br>
    Show them your resume and cover letter for feedback. Is it error free? Share with them a few job postings to which you applied and the strategies used. Did you focus on appropriate employers and jobs that need the skills you have to offer? Have you restricted your search too much geographically? Learn about the variety of resources available to you as no single job-search strategy can guarantee success.”<br>
    <i class="fas fa-award"style="font-size: 30px; color: tomato;"></i>&nbsp;Do an Internship<br>
    Job seekers can never get too much experience, and an internship is a great way to get it. Although it can feel like taking a step backwards to do an internship after college, more and more workers are using internships as a way to sharpen their existing skills or learn new ones in order to change careers. This is an especially good idea for graduates who didn’t have an internship while they were in school.<br>
